# DesignPatternCodeSamples

This is a collection of minigames made within Unity using a programming design patterns. There are a total of 10 of the more common design patterns, each folder contains a different minigame made using a design pattern. These were made during my CIS 452 class about design patterns in game development. All the minigames show my understanding of
each design pattern that I use.
